# Analyzing the result of an AB test

In this study project, we analyze the results of some badly performed AB test: the data does not fit with the initial design of the test; there are anomalies and discrepancies in the data.

Mostly used Pandas and Matplotlib. One graph with Plotly. Also performed the Z test measures.
