# Some basic analysis of catering in Moscow – with geocoding and maps

The data and the task are quite simple – but we made it a little bit more interesting enriching our addresses with geo coordinates (used paid API from a Dadata geocoder). Also acquired shape files of the city districts - so that we could make visualization by district level. So not a big deal of analysis but an exercise with cute maps.

Used Pandas for data analysis and Geopandas together with Contextily for the maps.
