# Portfolio: study projects and public reports I made for Yandex Research

Here are some of my works in the field of data analysis: 
1. Study projects I made for Yandex Praktikum Data Analysis course - Jupyter notebooks showing the analysis proccess from start to end.
2. Job projects I made while working for Yandex Public Research - links to final reports only, all the dirty job with data left behind the scene.

- [Telecom operator tariffs analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/telecom_tariff/)
<br>The analysis iself is quite basic but there is an interesting data handling case - setting properly the pay month based on the contract start date – made the right way taking into consideration calendar dates.
