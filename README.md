# Portfolio: study projects and public reports for Yandex Research

Here are some of my works in the field of data analysis: 
1. Study projects I made for Yandex Praktikum Data Analysis course - Jupyter notebooks showing the analysis proccess from start to end.
2. Job projects I made while working for [Yandex Public Research](https://yandex.ru/company/researches/) - links to final reports only, all the dirty job with data left behind the scene.

## Yandex Practicum projects
- [Mobile app unit economics analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/bi_project/)
<br>Calculating and analyzing all the basic marketing metrics: conversion, retention, LTV, ROI. Lots of beautiful graphs and highlight tables inside.

- [Residential property market analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/real_estate/)
<br>Quite big and detailed research of residential property in a big city. Lots of data cuts and descriptive statistics.

- [Video games market analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/video_games/)
<br>Extensive excercise in the field of video games. Enriched given data with some easily available info from open sources and ended with a much more interesting and reasonable result. Some nice graphs.

- [AB-test results analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/ab_test/)
<br>Analyze the results of a badly performed AB test – catching anomalies and discrepancies in the data.

- [Moscow catering market analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/city_cafe/)
<br>The data and the task are quite simple – but we enriched our addresses with geo coordinates an got some nice maps.

- [Telecom operator tariffs analysis](https://github.com/nicolayoguy/praktikum-projects/blob/main/telecom_tariff/)
<br>The analysis iself is quite basic but there is an interesting data handling case - setting properly the pay month based on the contract start date – made the right way taking into consideration calendar dates.

## Yandex Public Research reports
- Residential and working districts in Moscow
<br>An example of beautiful research based on quite simple data – a set of “home” and “job” user points from the Yandex navigation app.
<br>Using these data we analyzed which districts are mainly residential and which are working areas, do urban dwellers tend to work close to their jobs, and how much time they spend commuting.
<br>Interactive maps allowed us to visualize multidimensional data in a compact form.
